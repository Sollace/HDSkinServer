	Profiles

%p
	Every user that uploads their skin has a profile! Profiles are used to keep track of what textures a minecraft account owns as well as other neat little things.
%p
	Textures uploaded here are kept into a backlog up to 30 days, meaning if anyone accidentally replaces their skin and needs a way back, they can come here and search for it by their username.
%p
	Active textures are listed first.
